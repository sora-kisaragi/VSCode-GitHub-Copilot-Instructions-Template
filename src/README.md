# Source Code Directory

This directory contains the main source code for projects using this GitHub Copilot template.

## Purpose

This is the standard directory structure for source code in most software projects. When using this template for actual development projects, place your source code files here.

## Guidelines

- Follow the coding conventions specified in `.github/instructions/coding/` for your programming language
- Organize code by modules, components, or features as appropriate
- Use the framework-specific guidelines in `.github/instructions/framework/` when applicable
- Ensure all code follows the standards defined in the GitHub Copilot instructions

## Language-Specific Organization

Refer to the language-specific instruction files for proper organization:
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `.github/instructions/coding/javascript.instructions.md`
- Python: `.github/instructions/coding/python.instructions.md`
- C++: `.github/instructions/coding/cpp.instructions.md`
- C#: `.github/instructions/coding/csharp.instructions.md`
- And others as specified in the coding directory
