# Scripts Directory

This directory contains build, deployment, and utility scripts for projects using this template.

## Purpose

Centralized location for automation scripts that help with development, building, testing, and deployment processes.

## Common Script Types

- **Build Scripts**: Compilation and build automation
- **Test Scripts**: Automated testing execution
- **Deployment Scripts**: Deployment automation
- **Setup Scripts**: Environment setup and initialization
- **Utility Scripts**: Development helper scripts
- **Linting Scripts**: Code quality and formatting checks
- **CI/CD Scripts**: Continuous integration and deployment

## Guidelines

- Make scripts executable (`chmod +x`)
- Include clear documentation in script headers
- Follow shell scripting best practices
- Support multiple platforms when possible (cross-platform scripts)
- Use appropriate scripting languages:
  - Bash/Shell for Unix-like systems
  - PowerShell for Windows
  - Python for cross-platform utilities
  - Node.js scripts for JavaScript projects

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names: `build.sh`, `test.sh`, `deploy.sh`
- Include file extensions: `.sh`, `.ps1`, `.py`, `.js`
- Use kebab-case for multi-word script names

## Integration

Scripts should integrate well with:
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Package manager scripts (npm scripts, etc.)
- IDE tasks and configurations
