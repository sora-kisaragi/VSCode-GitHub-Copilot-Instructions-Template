# Task Management Guidelines

- Use GitHub Issues to track all tasks and features whenever accessible.
- For each task in an Issue, include:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Labels (e.g., "bug", "enhancement", "documentation")
  - Assignee(s)
- If the repository or Issues are accessible but the relevant Issue does not exist:
  - Create a new Issue with the planned task and register it.
- If GitHub Issues cannot be accessed at all:
  - Create a Markdown task list as a temporary placeholder to organize tasks.
- Track task progress by updating issue status or checkboxes in the Markdown list.
- Prioritize tasks according to project milestones or long-term implementation plan.
- Use consistent formatting for task lists:
  - `- [ ] Task description` → Not started
  - `- [x] Task description` → Completed
- Reference issue numbers in commits or PRs when tasks are completed.
