# Design Directory

This directory contains high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD) documents.

## Expected Files

As specified in `.github/instructions/documentation.instructions.md`:

- `HLD.md` - High-level architecture, main components, interactions, and responsibilities
- `LLD.md` - Low-level design, detailed logic, data structures, pseudo-code, or class diagrams

## Guidelines

- **HLD**: Focus on architecture overview, system components, and their interactions
- **LLD**: Include detailed implementation logic, data structures, and algorithms
- Use Mermaid diagrams for:
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Class diagrams (`classDiagram`)
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Flowcharts
- Link to related requirements in `../requirements/`
- Use LaTeX syntax for complex mathematical formulas when needed
